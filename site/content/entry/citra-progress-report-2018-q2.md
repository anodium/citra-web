Hello everyone to the summer (or winter, for those on the southern half of this
Earth) edition of Citra's progess reports. Although not very many changes have
happened, most have been focused on accuracy improvements and sorely needed user
experience improvements. Now, enough appetizing, have your entr&eacute;e:

## [Add pause, speed limit hotkeys](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/pull/3594) by [valentinvanelslande](https://github.com/valentinvanelslande)

Let's start with a simple but sweet one &emdash; you can now assign hotkeys to
pausing, unpausing, and toggling speed limiting. By default, you can pause with
<kbd>F4</kbd> and toggle speed limiting with <kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd></kbd>.
But, of course, you can bind these actions to other keys in the Settings.
