Past the red leaves and into the icy tundra in the midst of winter comes the present.
This time we'll be covering not one, but two months of progress! With a great many
changes all around, this article is going to be packed to the brim with all the
new goodies that have come to Citra those crimson months.

But, enough faffing about! Let's get right into it:

## [citra-qt : Adding fullscreen mode](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/pull/3001) by [Styleoshin](https://github.com/Styleoshin)

One of the most requested features for Citra, second only to controller support,
has been enlarging the window to cover the entirety of the screen. After almost
a year of requests on both the Citra Discourse and Discord servers, [Styleoshin](https://github.com/Styleoshin)
has finally delivered!

{{< figure src="/images/entry/citra-progress-report-2017-october-november/fullscreen.png" 
    title="No more pesky window décor!" >}}

Simply go into `View → Fullscreen`, or just strike the Alt + Return keycombo, and
enjoy Citra to its fullest on your largest monitor.
