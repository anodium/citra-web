As the year draws to a close, work on Citra absolutely doesn't! A lot of technical
changes under the hood, from applets to IPC, have made Citra even more accurate
and laid a foundation for even more goodies the next year.

## Conclusion

As always, [changes big or small](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/graphs/contributors?from=2017-12-01&to=2017-12-31&type=c)
are vital to the project. Brick by brick, Citra will eventually be an accurate
emulation of the Nintendo 3DS.
