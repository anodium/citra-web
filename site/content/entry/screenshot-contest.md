Citra's website has a nice little [screenshot gallery](/screenshots/) that
showcases the very best that Citra can be. And those very same screenshots
are displayed to everyone that navigates to our front page, via the jumbotron.
Unfortunately, that gallery hasn't been updated in ages, because we're mainly
focusing on Citra itself.

We want this gallery to be chock full of demonstrations of what Citra is and can
be, so we've made a little contest!

Here's how to participate:

1. Make an account on the Citra forums, if you haven't done so already. If you
already have an account, do not make another one! Alternate or duplicate accounts
will be **disqualified**.

2. Using the latest *official* Citra Canary or Nightly release, open a game and
take screenshots. Make sure the entire window, including decoration and border,
is visible. Make sure to take the screenshot while in 3x upscaled mode. Entries
not using an official Citra release, that don't show the entire window, or are
not at 3x resolution, will be **disqualified**.

3. Make a post on the Citra forums for *each* screenshot you want to submit, and
set its category to "Screenshot Contest Entry". Do not make more than 5 entries,
or you will be **disqualified**.

4. Heart the posts that you like the most! The winner will be the top 3 most
hearted screenshots. (Limit 1 prize per user.)

Entries will be accepted until `$(ENTRY SUBMISSION DUE)`, and the category will
then be locked to allow time for people to vote. **NOTE:** You do *not* have to
submit screenshots yourself to vote! You only need a Citra forums account, but
your votes will be **null and void** if you make alternate or duplicate accounts!

The three winners will be announced at `$(ENTRY SUBMISSION DUE)` right here on
the blog, and will be messaged privately by a forum moderator to claim their
reward. Speaking of prizes, each of the three winners will get:

3. A faceplate for their New Nintendo 3DS

2. A hardcover copy of *Hyrule Historia*

1. A **brand-new Nintendo New 3DS**!

We're extremely excited to see what you all have in store, so get out there and
submit those screenshots!
